# Ecol_3500_Island_colonize
Simulates colonization of islands at varying distances from mainland
Uses correlated random walks to simulate dispersal of 10 species
Users can visualize whether species tracks overlap three islands
Near (N), Medium (M) and Far (F). Users can alter tortuosity (in radians)
of CRW paths
